# 🧠 JS | React | Next.js Practice Playground 🚀

Welcome to my **learning playground** – a place where I explore, experiment, and evolve as a developer. This repository is my journey through JavaScript, React, and Next.js. Everything I'm currently learning or practicing gets its place here, all neat and organized – just the way I like it! ✨

## 🗂️ What's Inside?

🧩 **Modular Learning**  
Each part of this repo reflects a piece of my learning journey — from basic JavaScript drills to React components, and eventually full-blown Next.js sections.

🧠 **Knowledge Hub**  
Whenever I learn something new, it finds a home here. This project is a central hub to track my progress and revisit concepts when needed.

💡 **Custom Tools – like `codeFinder.js`**  
One of my first cool experiments in this repo is `codeFinder.js`, a JavaScript utility that scans for custom elements with `id="code"` and styles them like a real code editor (think VS Code vibes). It brings code snippets to life ✨.

🛠️ **React Section**  
I’ve already added some React practice examples and plan to grow this section with more advanced components and patterns.

⚙️ **Next.js Coming Soon**  
A full Next.js section is on the roadmap – to bring all this knowledge into real-world app structure and routing.

## 📌 Why This Project?

I believe in **organized growth**. Instead of jumping from one tutorial to another, I’ve created this centralized space to:

- Practice consistently 🎯
- Improve continuously 🔁
- Keep everything tidy and accessible 🗃️

This isn’t just a repo – it’s my **personal dev lab**.
